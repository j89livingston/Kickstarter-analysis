# **Theater Kickstarter Success Analysis**

## This analysis report will find the best time and funding amount for a successful Theater-based Kickstarter

### Main Analysis
  I was able to compile a large Theater Kickstarter dataset, condenced down from a large set of different types of kickstarters from between 2009-2017. After narrowing down Theater Kickstarters by month, year, goal amount and pledged amount, we were able to have further insight into this information. We can now pinpoint down to what month and what goal amount had the greatest success rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Chart, we can see two important points: 
1. May has the most successful outcome 
2. December has the least successful outcome

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the Chart, we can conclude:
1. Goals $4999 and under had the highest success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties 
  This analysis was fairly straight-forward. There could have been issues with the Outcomes based on Goals dataset if you didn't include an 'equal to' value to the greater/less than count. By testing both ways, you could quickly tell the importance of exact amounts in this dataset.

### Results
  In conclusion, we can see the best results for a Theater Kickstarter is to start in May for under the goal amount of $4999. It not only contains the the highest success rate, but also contained most of the total projects while maintaining the high success rate. A helpful data chart would be seeing the successful goal amount brackets in May, to see if more expensive kickstarters would be just as successful in that month. A dataset like that could potentially optimize the success rate further. There are some limitation to what we can predict with this information. Weather, current events, or even a pandemic could skew or change this data completely.
